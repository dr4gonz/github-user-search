## Description
This project will allow users to search GitHub for a user via GitHub's api.  A successful search will show the user information, including name, alias, date the account was created, and a list of their personal repositories.  The user can then click a repository to show more information in a separate panel.  The user can interact with the links in the page to take them to the found user's github page or to a specific repo page.
